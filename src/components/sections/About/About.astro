      Hi, I’m <strong>Joseph Turner</strong> — <strong
        >Senior Front-End Developer</strong
      >, code wrangler, and occasional bug whisperer. I’ve been
      building for the web for over <strong>13 years</strong> (yes,
      the internet was around back then), and I still love making
      things
      <strong>fast, clean, and user-friendly</strong>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I started out in <strong>design</strong>, which means I
      bring a sharp eye for detail to every line of code. I
      bridge the gap between <strong
        >design and development</strong
      >, making sure what ships is both functional <em>and</em> beautiful.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      These days, <strong>React</strong> and <strong
        >Next.js</strong
      > are my go-to tools, and I’ve led small teams to ship scalable
      apps and automate all the boring stuff. I might secretly enjoy
      a good linting error (don’t judge). I also love using <strong
        >AI</strong
      > — from brainstorming ideas to speeding up workflows — and
      I’m always looking for clever ways to integrate it into daily
      life and development.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Outside of work, I’m a <strong
        >husband and dad to six</strong
      >, passionate about <strong
        >health, fitness, and wellness</strong
      >, and always planning our next family adventure. I love <strong
        >exploring new places</strong
      >, tasting new foods, and collecting experiences that make
      life a little richer.
