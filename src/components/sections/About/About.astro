      Hi, I'm <strong>Joseph Turner</strong> â€” a front-end developer
      with over 13 years of experience building robust, user-focused
      web apps. With roots in design, I strive to craft intuitive
      and pixel-perfect interfaces.

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      Currently, I'm leading a small front-end team at <strong
        >Rugiet Health</strong
      >, improving development processes, enhancing code quality,
      and guiding the team through better code reviews, testing,
      and deployment strategies.
