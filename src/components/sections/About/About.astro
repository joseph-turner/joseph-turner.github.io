      About Me
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Hi, I'm <strong>Joseph Turner</strong> â€” a front-end developer
      with over six years of experience building robust, user-focused
      web apps. With roots in design, I strive to craft intuitive
      and pixel-perfect interfaces.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Currently, I'm leading a small front-end team at <strong
        >Rugiet Health</strong
      >, improving development processes, enhancing code quality,
      and guiding the team through better code reviews, testing,
      and deployment strategies.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      In my career, I've successfully led a major <strong
        >Next.js migration</strong
      > at <strong>Overstock.com</strong>, boosting site
      performance and streamlining deployments. I enjoy
      optimizing code for performance, refining UI details, and
      ensuring accessibility for all users.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
      Outside of work, I'm passionate about fitness, working on
      my <strong>fitness tracker app</strong>, and planning the
      next addition to my <strong>garden</strong>. If you're
      looking to collaborate or build something great, I'd love
      to hear from you!
