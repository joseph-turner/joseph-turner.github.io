        Hi, I’m <strong>Joseph Turner</strong> — <strong
          >Senior Front-End Developer</strong
        >, code wrangler, and occasional bug whisperer. I’ve been
        building for the web for over <strong>13 years</strong> (yes,
        the internet was around back then), and I still love making
        things <strong>fast, clean, and user-friendly</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I started out in <strong>design</strong>, which means I
        bring a sharp eye for detail to every line of code. I
        bridge the gap between <strong
          >design and development</strong
        >, making sure what ships is both functional <em>and</em>
        beautiful.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        These days, <strong>React</strong> and <strong
          >Next.js</strong
        > are my go-to tools, and I’ve led small teams to ship scalable
        apps and automate all the boring stuff. I might secretly enjoy
        a good linting error (don’t judge). I also love using <strong
          >AI</strong
        > — from brainstorming ideas to speeding up workflows — and
        I’m always looking for clever ways to integrate it into daily
        life and development.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Outside of work, I’m a <strong
          >husband and dad to six</strong
        >, passionate about <strong
          >health, fitness, and wellness</strong
        >, and always planning our next family adventure. I love <strong
          >exploring new places</strong
        >, tasting new foods, and collecting experiences that
        make life a little richer.
