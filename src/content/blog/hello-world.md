Welcome to my new blog! I'll be sharing notes about front-end development, design, and building fast, delightful web experiences. This is a quick test post to verify the blog scaffolding works.

- Expect content about React, Next.js, Astro, and modern CSS
- Short tutorials and longer case studies
- Occasional thoughts on tooling and workflows

Stay tuned!
